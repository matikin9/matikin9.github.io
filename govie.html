    <p>As of mid-2019, I've worked in local government for 12 years.  I could say plenty about how and why it's dysfunctional but I'd rather focus on how we're going to fix it.</p>
    
    <p>In 2015, one of my bosses at the time was on the Count of Los Angeles' Open Data Portal Steering Committee.  An email had been circulating about <em>hackathons</em> and they were intrigued.  My boss tasked me with attending one of these events to find out what it was all about.  That's when I attended my first civic hackathon, hosted by Hack for LA.  I was hooked immediately.  People were excited about solving government's problems!  I could leverage my years of government experience to help solve those problems!  That led to my heavy involvement in <strong><a href="tech-for-good.html">the world of civic tech</a></strong>.</p>
