    <h1>Nina Kin</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>After I majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2006, I did a short stint at a tech company in San Francisco where I got real good at SQL, learned to write test suites in Selenium, and got a whiff of working under Agile project management.  Then I promptly left to go work for the County of Los Angeles because it was a stable government job with health insurance and retirement benefits.</p>
    
    <p>Over the next several years I learned to code in Visual Basic and C# by debugging and rewriting legacy code as well as building new websites and applications.  Our team was small and my title of "Systems Analyst" was incredibly vague so I ended up doing anything and everything.  I met with users to understand their needs and write up requirements.  I designed and built the databases, backends, and frontends, going from WebForms to MVC and Entity Framework.  I dabbled in a bit of raster and vector graphic design work using Gimp and Inkscape.</p>
    
    <p>Over the years, I had to pick up additional technologies - Adobe Flex and Actionscript for interactive dashboards, proprietary systems where I had to go to week-long trainings, and picking apart undocumented Java code handed off to us by a contractor (fun).  The projects themselves were fascinating and I learned a ton.  I designed a custom CMS for our Intranet website (a poor idea in hindsight).  I built a role-based file sharing website (like Dropbox but internal).  I built some public-facing sites.  I worked on applications where I learned about government budgeting, internal auditing, government procurement, fraud investigations, and mileage reimbursements.</p>
    
    <p>The vast majority of that work was non-Agile and non-open source.  Five years into my career I had a minor personal crisis.  If I wanted any chance of a private industry career in tech, I needed experience in open source and an understanding of Agile methodologies!  I started attending tech meetups and coding side projects.  I dabbled in Ruby/Rails, Python, PHP/WordPress, Node.js, MEAN stack, Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, Git, etc., anything and everything to get a feel for what the rest of the world was using. </p>
    
    <p>I started incorporating open source into my government work and convinced my co-workers to as well.  I learned WordPress enough to take on a few freelance jobs building custom WordPress websites.  It was so much fun, but I stopped because I realized I didn't want to code AND run a business.</p>
    
    <p>These days I don't do much coding at all.  My work life now consists of writing and responding to emails, estimating timelines, running meetings, prioritizing tasks, and delegating to others.  My role is probably best described as being an Internal Product Manager.  Any development I now do is usually JAMstack of some sort, often Jekyll.</p>
    
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    
    <p>I have a background in Computer Science and I started off my career as a Web Developer.  I've worked at the County of Los Angeles since 2007.  While my early programming experience was with Microsoft .NET, Adobe Flex, and various proprietary frameworks, I've spent many years learning a number of open source frameworks and libraries.  These days my role is that of an Internal Product Manager though I'll build JAMstack sites on the side for fun.</p>
    
    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps something that brings me closer to <strong><a href="govie.html">my vision</a></strong>.</p>
